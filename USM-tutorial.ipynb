This notebook serves as an introduction to applying unseen species models to cultural data using Copia.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The study addresses a key challenge in historical literature research: the incomplete transmission of sources over centuries, leading to a potential underestimation of the literary diversity of the past. By employing eco-diversity statistical methods on Middle Dutch chivalric epics, the study suggests that previous estimates of text loss might have been too conservative. These methods unveil that up to half, or possibly more, of the original texts may have been lost over time, highlighting the need for quantitative tools to adjust our understanding of historical literary diversity.\n",
